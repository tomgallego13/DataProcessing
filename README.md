# DataProcessing

Running this program:
1. Cloning the git repository
2. Running java main, which will lead you to the menu on CLI

Modifications:
- I think the assignment can become official if it wasn't layed out as simple as it is now. As in previous assignments, we would have to read and get in depth with readings about the topic. I think this should be the case here as the simple database program isn't as effective when it comes to learning how databases and data processing works. I do enjoy the simplicity of creating the program and it does fit along with other coding projects done in this class. I also think adding some suggestions on how to go about creating the program can be helpful. I personally went with a stack implementation and found it way easier than other methods.
